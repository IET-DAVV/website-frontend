But, do all students enjoy their campus life? The answer is that none of the students enjoy their campus life at least till the end of their first year. This is mainly because of ragging.`,

        `What is ragging? Ragging means causing, inducing, compelling or forcing a student, whether by way of a practical joke or otherwise, to do any act which detracts from human dignity or exposes him to ridicule or to forbear from doing any lawful act, by injuring him or by using criminal force to him.`,
